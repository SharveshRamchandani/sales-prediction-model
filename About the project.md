# sales-prediction-model
A linear regression sales prediction model utilizes historical sales data to identify and quantify the relationship between independent variables (e.g., advertising spend) and sales, enabling accurate future sales predictions.

Creating a sales forecasting model using Linear Regression involves several steps, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. Below is an in-depth analysis of each step:

1. Data Collection and Exploration:
Collect historical sales data, including relevant features such as marketing expenses, seasonality, and other factors influencing sales.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, outliers, and patterns.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers appropriately. Impute missing values or consider removing outliers based on domain knowledge.
Encode categorical variables if necessary using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scale numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
3. Feature Engineering:
Create new features if needed, such as lag features to capture time dependencies or interaction terms between existing features.
Identify and select relevant features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
4. Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
5. Model Selection:
Choose Linear Regression as the model for sales forecasting, as it is suitable for predicting a continuous target variable.
6. Model Training:
Fit the Linear Regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
7. Model Evaluation:
Use the testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Analyze residuals to check for patterns or systematic errors in predictions.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Tune hyperparameters if applicable. Linear Regression typically doesn't have many hyperparameters, but regularization parameters (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) could be adjusted.
9. Interpretation:
Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on sales.
Assess the statistical significance of coefficients, and consider p-values.
Analyze the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement.
10. Visualization:
Visualize the model's predictions against actual sales to understand where the model performs well or poorly.
Plot feature importance to identify key factors influencing sales.
11. Monitoring and Updating:
Implement a system for ongoing monitoring of the model's performance.
Consider periodic updates to the model as new data becomes available.
Additional Considerations:
Time Series Aspects: If your data has a time component, consider time series analysis techniques, such as autoregressive models or moving averages.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

I have attached the datasets which i have used namely train 1 and train prefer using train dataset as it reduces the complexity and increases the understandibility
of the user,as an student with limited experience in the field of Machine Learning, i would suggest everyone to continue with train dataset and not with train 2 dataset. i had encounterd minor errors using tain 2 dataset
